I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By default, apps created using `create-react-app` have a README.md file that looks like [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Indeed, the README.md file you're now reading originally looked like that. I have since changed it to look the way it looks today.
